          Hi, you're at Open IDE's home.
          <br />
          The source of this project has been made open for all but the servers
          cannot yet afford to have open end-points [how ironic], which could
          result in heavy traffic and ultimately, server slowdown. OpenIDE
          depends on third party services to host its backend, which supports only shared-hosting on their free plan, causing higher latency and slower response. I'm working on a solution to this problem.
          <br />
          <br />
          Until then, you can read more about the architecture of Open IDE or
          explore its working.
        </p>
        <div className="explore">
          <Link className="url" to={"/ide"}>
            <Button variant="outline-dark" className="exp">
